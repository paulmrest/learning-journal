# GitHub Pages and Markdown

[GitHub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub) Pages is a feature that allows repositories to be published as modern, attractive, websites, rather than simply a list of files and documentation.

GitHub Markdown is a lightweight formatting language (similar to HMTL, although with a more limited scope) used throughout GitHub's platform, including on GitHub pages. Markdown formatting can be used in any markdown file (.md or .markdown).

For example, Markdown can be used to designate links with a variety of options, such as was used above for the "GitHub" link in the first paragraph to Wikipedia.

\[Link to Google](https://www.google.com/)

In the above example, the page would show the text "Link to Google" and when a user clicks it it they would be brought to the URL "https://www.google.com/".

One can create lists, both unordered and ordered:

```
Unordered list:
* Unordered item one
* Unordered item two

Ordered list:
1. Ordered item one
1. Ordered item two
```
Which render as, respectively: 

Unordered list:
* Unordered item one
* Unordered item two

Ordered list:
1. Ordered item one
1. Ordered item two

You can also **bold** and *italicize* text:

```
**This sentence is a bold one.**
This sentence is normal but it has a **bold** word.
We're in need of *italics* to emphasize this point.
**This bold sentence needs even more emphasis on its *italics*.
```

Which render as:

**This sentence is a bold one.**  
This sentence is normal but it has a **bold** word.  
We're in need of *italics* to emphasize this point.  
**This bold sentence needs even more emphasis on its *italics*.**
