Hi There!

My name is Paul and I've been dabbling in coding since 2011. In 2015 I managed to complete an iOS app and got it published to the App Store (since removed as I stopped paying the annual developer fee).

An archive site with my app's description: http://flounds.appstor.io/

I'm presently enrolled in Code Fellows's 102 level class, and scheduled to complete 401 on 9/11/2020. I am looking forward to finally learning to be a full stack developer and get my career in software dev underway.

Outside of development and computer science in general, I enjoy reading and writing, and the great outdoors of the Pacific Northwest (bicycling for commuting and sport, hiking, skiing, etc...). I also have a deep abiding love of astronomy and astrophysics, and someday would like to get back into amateur astronomy (the light pollution of Pugetopolis made my light bucket of a telescope rather useless).

## Growth Mindset

The core of growth mindset, for me, is a rejection of the idea that skills, capabilities, and capacities are static, or even *that* difficult to change. With motivation and validation (positive reinforcement), anyone can buid any skillset, and expand both their capabilities and capacities.

For myself, I three reminders I need to stay in a growth mindset:
* Permission to be bad at something at first.
* Seek help and guidance from others.
* Find motivation in other's success.
