Professional Competency Self-Assessment

Strongest Three

Curiosity - I am, sometimes to my detriment, insatiably curious. I always want to see how far down the rabbit hole goes, and how far down all the connected holes go as well. As I write this, I completed the "install fest" and plan on researching each and every tool I wasn't already familiar with that I just installed.

Openness - this was a hard won quality for me, having spent a good chunk of my life thinking I needed to be perfect and amazing at everything the first time I tried it. Listening to constructive criticism, and being able to throw out, or at least heavily modify, something I was once proud of has been a huge asset.

Writing - I adore elegant, complex, ideas. And being able to communicate those ideas even more so. This is a craft I have put a huge amount of time and effort into (writing a lot since I was 13, Modern Lit degree), and part of what I enjoy about code is the mix of creativity and logic and conveying a complex idea.


Top Three for Growth

Handling ambiguity - I have certainly improved on this over the years, but I still get frustrated with ambiguous instructions, scope, or goals.

Analytical Thinking - this is more the type of "on your feet" analytical thinking that I struggle with. When I'm able to spend time by myself and mull, I can excel at analysis, but trying to juggle multiple factors into a coherent picture in a few seconds or minutes, usually not. This does get better the more familiar and confident I am in a topic.

Prioritization - this connects with the curiosity. When working on a project I can, if I don't stop myself, spend more time than I should researching related, but ultimately out of scope, topics, just because they seemed interesting. As a result, I can struggle at times to stay prioritized on the project at hand.
